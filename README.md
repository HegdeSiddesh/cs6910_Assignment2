# CS6910 Assignment 2
Learn how to use CNNs: train from scratch, finetune a pretrained model, use a pre-trained model as it is. The link for the wandb report is available [here](https://wandb.ai/hithesh-sidhesh/Assignment_2/reports/CS6910-Assignment-2--VmlldzoxNzI3Nzcy).


##Part A:

This part deals with training a CNN model from scratch and performing predictions for the iNaturalist dataset. The implementation details are mentioned in the readme file inside the "Part A" folder.

##Part B:

This part deals with using a pretrained model and finetuning it, so as to perform prediction on the iNaturalist dataset. The implementation details are mentioned in the readme file inside the "Part B" folder.


##Part C:

This part deals with using a pretrained model YOLO for video captioning task. The implementation details are mentioned in the readme file inside the "Part C" folder.
